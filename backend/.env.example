# 2. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
# 3. Go to App passwords (under Security)
# 4. Select Mail and the device you're using
# 5. Copy the generated app password and use it here

# Alternative: Use Ethereal for testing (no real emails sent)
# Set USE_ETHEREAL=true to use Ethereal instead of a real email service
